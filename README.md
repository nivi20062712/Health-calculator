# 🩺 Health Calculator Mini Project (C Language)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is a simple and interactive **Health Calculator** developed in **C language**.  
It allows users to calculate important health parameters such as **BMI**, **Daily Calorie Requirement**, and **Heart Rate Range**, along with a **Basic Arithmetic Calculator** for quick computations.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a user-friendly C program that helps individuals monitor and manage their health metrics easily through console-based interaction.

---

## 🧩 Features
- 🧮 **BMI Calculator** – Computes Body Mass Index and classifies user as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.  
- 🍎 **Calorie Calculator** – Estimates daily calorie requirements based on BMR and activity level.  
- ❤️ **Heart Rate Calculator** – Calculates maximum and target heart rate range based on age.  
- ➕ **Basic Calculator** – Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **Language:** C  
- **Compiler:** Turbo C / GCC  
- **IDE (optional):** Code::Blocks / Dev-C++ / Visual Studio Code  
- **Header Files:** stdio.h, math.h
